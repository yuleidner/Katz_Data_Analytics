    "\n",
    "**Markdown Elements**\n",
    "* A Markdown header cell that contains a title, date, and your name\n",
    "* Markdown cells that explain various steps of your python code in language that’s easy for a non-technical stakeholder to understand\n",
    "* **Bold** and *italic* emphasis in appropriate locations\n",
    "* At least one bulleted or numbered list\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Elements**\n",
    "* Optional, but fun: try “import antigravity”.\n",
    "* Create a numeric variable and demonstrate simple math on that variable\n",
    "* Create a short dictionary that tells me something about yourself, e.g. your career goals, favorite sports teams, country you’re from.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Upload the notebook to Github**\n",
    "* On https://yu.instructure.com/courses/37517/assignments/81939?module_item_id=379329, give the Github link to the folder that contains your notebook (the folder named \"Module_1\" or something similar.\n",
    "* Using Zoom or Screencast-O-Matic, record myself and/or my screen (2 minutes max), introducing myself and describing my code and explaining it to a naive stakeholder. For now, I'm just being graded on completing this, as I learn to explain your work smoothly and simply. Submit the video file or the link to your instructor!"
