# M5 Muscle Builder
## Analysing NYC Energy Consumption with Pandas
### This folder contains a [Python file](https://github.com/yuleidner/Katz_Data_Analytics/blob/master/M5/M5%20Data%20Analyitcs.ipynb) which analyzes Energy Consuption in NYC. This was a class assignment, intended too demonstrate our abilities to use Python and Pandas to analyze a set of data.

In this assignment, I will

* Import data in csv form directly from NYC Open Data
* Convert the csv into a Pandas DataFrame
* Clean up columns and data in the DataFrame
* Break the DataFrame down into smaller dataframes to analyze them with Algabraic and Pandas functions
