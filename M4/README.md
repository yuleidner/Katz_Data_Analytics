## Analysing NYC Water Use with Numpy
### This folder contains a [Python file](https://github.com/yuleidner/Katz_Data_Analytics/blob/master/M4/M4%20Data%20Analyitcs.ipynb) which analyzes Water Consumption in NYC over a 40 year period. This was a class assignment, intended too demonstrate our abilities to use Python and Numpy to analyze a set of data.

This folder contains a downloaded csv of data from [Water-Consumption-In-The-New-York-City](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Water-Consumption-In-The-New-York-City/ia2d-e54m)

This data has 40 years of data provides the annual water consumption, in millions of gallons per day (MGD) for each year. The dataset also presents the population of the City during that year and a calculated value of the gallons of water consumed in the City per person per day during that year.

You can find more details, or download an updated copy of the data yourself [here:](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Water-Consumption-In-The-New-York-City/ia2d-e54m)
