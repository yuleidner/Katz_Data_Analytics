# Module 3 Muscle Builder

I am a student in a Masters program for Data Analytics and Visualization.

For my 3rd week's assignment, I needed to create this README file (meta, I know) and [this](https://github.com/yuleidner/Katz_Data_Analytics/blob/master/M3/M3%20Data%20Analyitcs.ipynb) python file.

In the Jupyter Notebook, I'm going to do the following:

Reproduce all the things that I did in the [last module](https://github.com/yuleidner/Katz_Data_Analytics/blob/master/M2/M2%20Data%20Analyitcs.ipynb)

Do some exciting new stuff:

* Using a loop, show the unicode value for each letter, using ord().
* For each lowercase letter of the alphabet, come up with a unique integer that is some calculated combination of the unicode value and/or the ordinal position (1-26) of the letter in the alphabet.
* Make sure the code for each letter is unique, so that no code number repeats for more than one letter!
* Create a dictionary that gives, for each letter of the alphabet, the code value you created.
* Create an encoding function that takes a string of lower case letters and returns a list of integers representing a the code number given to each letter.
* Make sure the function will exit with a helpful message if there is an element in the string that isn’t encodable (isn’t a lowercase letter) or if it is not a string.
* Try out the function using the word "hello".
* Try out the function using the string "hello there".
* Try out the function using an integer.
