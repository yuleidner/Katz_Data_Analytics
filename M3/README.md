# Module 2 Muscle Builder

I am a student in a Masters program for Data Analytics and Visualization.

For my 2nd week's assignment, I needed to create this README file [meta, I know] and [this](https://github.com/yuleidner/Katz_Data_Analytics/blob/master/M2/M2%20Data%20Analyitcs.ipynb) python file.

In the Jupyter Notebook, I'm going to do the following:

* Create a list of all lower case letters and a separate list of the numbers 1-26.
* Use a for loop to print out which numbers in my list are divisible by 4
* Print both lists and show their types.
* Using zip, create a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of the lower case letter and its numerical equivalent, 1-26.
* Print the list of tuples, the type of the list, and the type of the first element in that list.
* Using list comprehension, create a list of letters for which have ordinal values (1-26) that are multiples of 4.
