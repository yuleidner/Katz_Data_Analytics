# M6 Muscle Builder
## Working with non-standard file type
### This folder contains a few Python files and some dependant data sets:
#### [M6 Arff Data Analytics](https://github.com/yuleidner/Katz_Data_Analytics/blob/master/M6/M6%20Arff%20Data%20Analytics.ipynb): Data Analysis of a .arff file of training data for phishing websites
####  [M6 Fixed Width Data Analysis](https://github.com/yuleidner/Katz_Data_Analytics/blob/master/M6/M6%20Fixed%20Width%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb): Data Analysis of a fixed width file of Percipitation Data in US cities
####  [M6 SHP Data Import](https://github.com/yuleidner/Katz_Data_Analytics/blob/master/M6/M6%20SHP%20Data%20Import.ipynb): Attempting to import a non tabulat data file of nyc Bicycle lanes.
#### [M6 MySQL Quiz](https://github.com/yuleidner/Katz_Data_Analytics/blob/master/M6/M6%20MySQL%20Quiz.ipynb): Me running through a code quiz from class

##### I had a much harder time this week than normal. Lack of time? Non-related work in class? Either way, I relied heavily on the example assingment module created by the professor.

As always, python files have been otpimized for jupyter notebooks.
