In [this](https://github.com/yuleidner/Katz_Data_Analytics/blob/master/M7/M7%20PROJECT.ipynb) Notebook, I will attempt to perform an exploratory analysis of NYC's open dataset on Car Crashes. I use pandas to ingest and modify data, and then attemp a few diffternt kinds of visualizations.


* Data: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95
* Matplotlib Visualization of Car crash fatalities in NYC over time
* Pandas Visualization of Fatal Car Crash Causes
* Seaborn Visualization of Plotting summed counts of fatalities over time by travel type

I made liberal use of the following functions:

sum()
cumsum()
groupby()
merge()
value_counts()
unique()
pd.to_datetime()
